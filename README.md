## About
- Stage mode. 
  To increase the fun of game, I import a **stage mode**. There are five stages for player to explore.
- Timer and banner. 
  The initial time of timer and the banner are set by current stages. More difficult the stage is, longer the initial time is.
- Cute design and novel operation.
  There are three areas in a main page. First of all, a thin long area contains the banner. Then, there are four cards on the sky of night. If you touch any of them, its color will change. Lastly, you can see a big circle, consists of five small circles, including plus, subtract, multiply, divide symbol and 'return' symbol. Touch them to control the process of cards. 

## Faults
- Strage breakdowns. 
  When I have been testing it, I often find some surprise breakdowns. I think that it may be the inner fault of WeChat.
- Not a quite good expression production method.
  Maybe, you think the game is so easy that you can write it right now. Yeah, you are a genius. But please take some time to deal with producing the right and **suitable** numbers for every stages. In my opinion, **suitalbe** means the difficulty of numbers must be suitalbe for the difficulty of stages.
